# Excel_to_CSV_Convertion
This repository provides a simple Python script to convert [Excel] files to [CSV] format using the 'pandas' library.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
  pip install pandas 
  pip install openpyxl

## Note:
  The r prefix in Python string literals is used to create raw strings.
  Raw strings treat backslashes (\) as literal characters and not as escape characters.
  This is particularly useful for file paths on Windows, where backslashes are common, but can also be interpreted as escape sequences.

  The 'openpyxl' library is a popular Python library used to read and write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.
  'pandas' relies on openpyxl to handle Excel files with the .xlsx extension.
  If you don't have openpyxl installed, pandas will not be able to read or write Excel files and will prompt you to install it.
